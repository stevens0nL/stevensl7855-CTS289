 CSC-289, Programming Capstone Project

This class is about using and understanding patterns in software development. You've already discovered a number of patterns so far:

Input, Processing, Output (IPO)
branches (if statements) and loops (while statements)
functions (turning a block of code into a reusable "verb")
In addition, you have at least begun to learn about classes and objects, a convenient way to "bundle" connected pieces of data and code into one unit.

The patterns we will learn in CSC 289 Programming Capstone Project are enterprise software patterns. In other words, after decades of software development in teams, different approaches have emerged, with different words to talk about those approaches.

The most basic pattern is Scrum, a form of Agile Software Development that has:

Enough structure to have some guideposts,
Not so much structure as to lose sight of what we're doing (writing code to meet a user need)
CSC 289 continues to work within the AlgoCratic Futures "educational work simulation". You will be treated as employees of a fictional company, and the way you keep that job, and advance in your skills and position, is to follow directions and be willing to try new strategies.
